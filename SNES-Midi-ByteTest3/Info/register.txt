	The 8-bit data should be written twice in the order of lower &
	upper. then, the parameter of rotation, enlargement and reduction
	should be set by its 16-bit area.

	The value down to a decimal point should be set to the lower
	8-bit. the most significant bit of the upper 8-bit is for the
	signed bit. (mp15 is the signed bit. there is a decimal point
	between m7 & m8)

	Set the value of "a" to register <211bh>. in the same way,
	set "b-d" to the registers <211ch>-<211eh>.

	* The complementary multiplication (16bit x 8bit) can be done by
	using registers <211bh> <211c>.
	when setting 16 bit data to register <211bh> and 8bit data to
	register <211ch>, the multiplication result can be indicated
	rapidly by reading registers <2134h>-<2136h>.

	The center coordinate (x0,y0) for rotation/enlargement/reduction
	can be designated by this register.

	The coordinate value of x0 & y0 can be designated by 13-bit
	(complement of 2).

	the register requires that the lower 8-bit is set first and the
	upper 5-bit is set. therefore, 13-bit data in total can be set.

	This register is used to designate the channel out of 8-channels.

	The channel which should be used can be designated by writing "1"
	to the bit of this channel. as soon as "1" is written to the
	bit (after a few cycles passed), the general purpose dma transfer
	will be started.

	When the general purpose dma of the designated channel is
	completed, the flag will be cleared.

	note:	Because the data area (register <4300>-) of each channel
	~~~~~	is held in common with the data of each h-dma channel, the
		channel designated by the h-dma channel designation
		register <420ch> can not be used.
		(it is prohibited to write "1" to the bit of the channel)
		therefore, 8 channels (ch0-ch7) should be assigned by the

	This address becomes the basic address on the a-bus during dma
	transfer period, and the address will be increased or decreased
	based on this address. (when the general purpose dma is performed
	it will be decreased.)


ADDRESS  : $43x5/$43x6/$43x7 (x: channel number 0-7)
NAME     : dasxl/dasxh/dasbx
CONTENTS : data address store by h-dma & number of byte to be transfered
	   settings by general purpose dma

	d7-d0	data address (low) 			 h-dma	43x5h
		number of bytes to be transfered (low)	gp-dma

	d7-d0	data address (high)			 h-dma	43x6h
		number of bytes to be transfered (high) gp-dma

	d7-d0	data bank					43x7h

          In case of h-dma
		This is a register which the indirect address will be
		stored automatically in the indirect addressing mode.
		the indirect address means the data address described
		on appendix-2. it is not necessary to read or write
		directly by the cpu except in special cases.

          In case of general purpose dma
		This is the register, which can set the number of byte
		to transfer or to be transfered. however, the number of
		byte "0000h" means "10000h".


ADDRESS  : $43x8/$43x9 (x: channel number 0-7)
NAME     : a2axl/a2axh
CONTENTS : table address of a-bus by dma < a2 table address

	d7-d0	a2 table address (low)				43x8h
	d7-d0	a2 table address (high)				43x9h

	These are the addresses, which are used to access the cpu & ram,
	and it will be increased automatically. (see appendix-2)

	The data of these registers are used as the basic address which
	is the addresss set by the "a1 table address". afterwards,
	because it will be increased or decreased automatically, it is
	necessary to set the address into this register by the cpu
	directly.

	Following apply to h-dma only:
		However, if the data which is transfered need to be changed
		by force, it can be done by setting the cpu memory address
		to this register. and also, the address of the cpu which is
		accessed currently will be changed by reading this register.


ADDRESS  : $43xa (x: channel number 0-7)
NAME     : ntrlx
CONTENTS : the number of lines to be transfered by h-dma›0;31;40m

	d7	continue
	d6-d0	number of lines to be transfered

	This is a register which shows number of lines for h-dma transfer
	(see appendix-2)

	The number of lines written to the cpu memory will be the basic
	number of line, it is not necessary to set the address into
	this register directly.
