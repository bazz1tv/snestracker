2.2 APU I/O PORTS

Ports 0-3 are ports which carry out data transmission to the SPCU through
the SPX bus and are composed of four 8-bit inport registers and four 8-bit
outport registers. Port nr registers can only write from the SPCU section
and can only read from the Sound-CPU section. The opposite is true of the
port nw registers. Since the composition of each of these ports is 
identical, an explanation will be made using Port Or and Port Ow as
examples.

1. Data is input into Port Or when the SCPU writes data into 2140H. Then
the contents of Ports Or are read when the Sound-CPU reads the data in 
00F4H ( this is also true of Ports 1r - 3r).

2. Data is written into Port Ow when the Sound-CPU writes data into the APU
I/O port (00F4H). Then the contents of Port OW are read when the SCPU reads
2140H ( this is also true of Ports 1w-3w).

3. When reset is carried out, the contents of Port nr registesr and Port nw
registers become "00" (n=0-3)

3. CONTROL REGISTER

3.1. THE PORT CLEAR FUNCTION BY MEANS OF THE CONTROL REG.

The ports are cleared to 00 when 1 is written into the Control register
port clear control bits PC32 PC10. When 0 is written in, they are not cleared.
When 1 is written into the port clear control bit PC10, both the port 0r
register and the port 1r register are cleared to 00. In the same manner, when
1 is written in PC32 both the port 2r register and the port 3r register are
cleared to 00.

*NOTE : D7 is used to control whether the top 64 bytes are mapped to the
onchip ROM or the external RAM.

Note : Clear Timing
Port clear is executed during the machine cycle following that in which
1 is written into the port clear control bit.
When port clear timings conflicts with write timing to the port in question
from the SFX bus, there are cases in which the contents of the register
in question become indeterminate.

ST0 is the Timer TO start/stop control bit the timer stops with 0 and
starts with 1. At this timer, it is necesary to input 1 into ST0 once
it has been changed to 0.
ST1 and ST2 are respectively the start/stop control bits of timers 
T1 and T2. Their function is identical to that of ST0.

NOTE : In regard to the timers, please see next section.


4. TIMERS

Fig. 4.1. Timer Section

The timers T0, T1 and T2 are each composed of a lower level 8-bit 
programmable interval timer connected to a upper level 4-bit up counter.
The 8-bit timer is made up of an 8-bit binary up counter, comparator, 
timer register and control circuit; and each of the timers T0, T1 and T2
is independently programmable.
The clock input to timers T0 and T1 from the prescaler is 8KHz ( 125 microS)
and that to timer T2 from the prescaler is 64KHz (15.6 microS).

4.2. TIMER ACTION

Since each timer T0, T1 and T2 is structured identically, explanation
will be made taking timer T0 as an example.
The lower level 8-bit timer of timer T0 is composed principally of
a binary up counter, which is incremented at each count clock input.
When its value corresponds to the contents of the timer register.
it is cleared to 00H. Simultaneously a pulse is generated to the
4-bit up counter.
The 4-bit up counter is composed principally of a binary up counter,
which increments at each input of a lower level pulse.
The action of the counter of timer T0 is controlled by the 0 bit of
the control register. When bit ST0 is 0 count up is suspended. Count
up commences when both upper level and lower level counters are cleared
by "1". Consequestly, in order to clear the counters, it is necessary
to set bit ST0 to "1" after having once set it to "0".
Writing into the timer register is carried out while the counter is
stopped. At this time, the minimun value of the write values is 01H
and the maximun values is 00H. Though it is not possible to read the
value of the timer register, it is possible to read the 4-bit values
CN0 at any time. When the values of CN0 is read, only the 4-bit up
counter section is cleared to "00".

                     |
                     |---------- Read Clear Pulse
                                                            ---
Action of timer T0 is stopped by means of the reset input ( POR = "1").
At this time of reset ST0 of the control register is "0", and CN0 and
TN0 of the timer register are indeterminate.
when CN is read, the 4-bit up counter alone is cleared through ..
internal timing, but the read clear pulse and the pulse to the 4-bit
up counter do not conflict with each other.
Consequently, when the pulse is input to the 4-bit up counter, the
values of CN will necessarily be incremented or when value of CN is
read. CN will be cleared and CN will become "0".

      Pitch is expressed by the total fouteen bits combining six
      lower level bits of P(H) and eight bits of P(L). At this time
      two upper bits of P(H) are invalid. ( Considered to be "0" at all
      times ).

      With f as the frequency of the reproduced sound, f0 ( f sub zero ) 
      as the frequency of the original sound (sound at the time of 
      recording), and p as the value expressed by the upper level 
      fourteen bits of P(H) and P(L), the following formula is formed :

                                P
                      f = f0 * ----

      The diagram below illustrates the relationship between p and the
      octaval ratio of the reproduced sound and the original sound.
      There are theoretically no limitations in the practical range so
      long as the original sound is converted lower, however, when
      converted higher, only up to approximately four times the
      frequency of the original sound can be accomodated.

      In terms of tone quality, the lower level 4 bits of P(L) should
      be set at 0 when possible in cases where pitch aberrations are
      not of concern.

6.2.2. COMPLETE VOICE REGISTERS
(1) KON, KOF
"Key on" and "Key off". D0-D7 correspond to Voice 0-7. When "1", key
on or key off are carried out ; when "0", neither is carried out.
These two registers need not be reset. With KOF, in regard to any
Voice in which "1" is written, whether in the ADSR mode or GAIN mode,
1 to 0 decreases at the rate of 8 nsec by means of the addition of the
fixed value 1/256. In writing in a succession of KON and KOF. two
Ts (62.4 microsec) or more should be released. (In writing in a
sucession of various data in less than two Ts, the data written in
may not be operable later.)

(2) PMOD

Pitch modulation is imposed on Voice i with OUTX of Voice(i-1) (i=1-7)
as a modulated wave. When Di = 1 it becomes modulation OX. ( For
example when D1=1, a modulated tone issues from Voice 1). However
modulation does no affect Voice0. Therefore, the bit D0 is not
operable. In regard to the method of pitch modulation, when y0 ( y sub
zero ), is the wave height value of the modulated wave and P is the
value of P(H) and P(L), then :

     x
    P   = P (t+y )
                0

               x 
The values of P  as above takes the place of P and is utilized as the
values of the picth at that time.

(3) NON

Noise on/off. D0-7 correspond to Voice 0-7. When on noise is issued
instead of sound source data. At this time, if sound source data of 
formants only is designated through the previous SRCN, then noise
is produced only for the length of time of the sound source data.
When reproduction for random lengths of time is desired, sound
source data incorporating a loop must necessarily be designated
through SRCN. In Addition even though two o more voices may be on,
the source of noise is the same.

Note : modulation can not be imposed on this noise.

7. CPU ORGANIZATION.

A Sony SPC700 series is used in the CPU core of the SFX sound source.
it is possible to access and address space of 64K bytes in the SPC
series CPU. Address classification of the memory space is made
according to purpose: and addresses 0000 - 00ff are called page 0
and addresses 0100 - 01ff are called page 1.
In regard to the data in this region, when direct page designation
is carried out by direct page flaq (P) within the program status
word, it is possible to carry out data processing in wide-ranging
addresing modes with a small number of cycles.

Within the CPU there are the universal registers A,X and Y, program
status ward (PSW) of the varius flags, program counter (PC), and
stack pointer (SP).

The A register is operable by the greatest number of commands,
and becomes and 8-bit operation accumulator. When 16-bit 
operations are carried out, it becomes paired with Y register
and becomes the lower lever 8-bit register of the 16-bit
accumulator.
The X and Y registers, in addition to their function as universal
registers, are used in various operations, such as the function
as index register of various index addressing modes, the function
as dual-address command source, destination address register, etc.

In the command set there are single address commands which carry
out arithmetic and logical operations centered in the A register
and dual address commands which can designate random address
within the direct page as source address and destination addresses.

In regard to bit processing diversified by control purpose. Boolean
bit operation commands are applicable to the 8K byte range of
data of addresses 0000 - 1fff. Morever, in regard to the bits
within the total space of the 64K bytes, commads of multiple bit
test and set, test and reset are provided for. For the purpose of
data which must be systematized or in order to carry out data
processing rapidly. It is possible to operate 16-bit data with a
single commad. Addition, subtraction, comparison and transferrance
are possible between two byte of continuous 16-bit data within the
direct page and the paired Y register and A register. In addition
increment and decrement of continuous 16-bit data within the
direct page are possible.

There are multiplication and division commands for the purpose
of rapid data processing and processing of data ina variety of
forms. Multiplication is 8-bit x 8-bit with no sign and is
carried out with the multiplicand stored in the Y register and
the multiplier stored in the A register; the result is entered
into the Y, A 16-bit accumulator. Division is 16bits/8bits with
no sign and carried out with the divident stored in the Y, A 16
bit accumulator and the divisor stored in the X register : the
resulting quotient is entered into the A register and the
remainder is entered intro the Y register.
In the processing of decimal data, there are decimal (addition,
subtraction) correcting commands in regard to the results of
both addition and subtraction.

In regard to branched commands, there are relative branched
commands according to the conditions of the various status
flags, branched commands according to the conditions of set
or reset of random bits with the direct page, etc. In addition,
in regard to looped branched commands, there are comparision
branched commands and subraction branched commands, and for
these there are two types of addressing modes.

In regard to subroutine call commands, there are subroutine
address direct designation three-byte call commands within
the 64K bytes. two-byte call commands for calling subroutines
of specific areas, and 16 portion one-byte call commands using
call table: it is possible to improve byte efficiency through
proper useage in response to the frequency of subroutine use.



1. CPU REGISTERS


Withing the CPU are the registers necessary for the execution of
the various commands. These are an A register (note : functions
as an 8-bit accumulator). X register, Y register (8-bit universal
register which can also be used as index register). PSW ( program
status ward). SP (stack pointer), etc. These are all 8-bit 
registersm but the PC (program counter) is made up of 16 bits.

           N = Negative Flag
           V = Overflow Flag
           P = Direct Page Flag
           H = Half Carry Flag
           Z = Zero Flag
           C = Carry Flag (Bit Accumulator)



(1) A REGISTER

This register is used as an 8-bit accumulator.
At times of 16-bit operation commands. it becomes a register for
retaining low byte data in the 16-bit accumulator made up of this
paired with the Y register. When operation commands are issued, it
becomes the multiplier register and low byte data of the product is
entered. When divison commands are issued, paired with the Y register
it formulates the dividend and the resulting quotient is entered.

(2) X REGISTER

In addition to its role as a universal data register, it also
functions as an index register when index addressing is being
carried out. In addition, it is also used as a two-address command
destination address register and X register indirect address register.
In division commands, it vecomes the divisor register.


(3) Y REGISTER

In additon to its role as a universal data register, it also functions
as an index register when index addressing is being carried out, In
addition, it is also used as a two-address command source address
register.
When carrying out 16-bit operation commands, it becomes the register
which retains the high byte data of the 16-bit accumulator which is
made up of the pairing of this with the A register. When
multiplication commads are being carried out, it becomes the dividend
register and the product high byte data is entered.
When carrying out division commands, paired with the A register it
formulates the dividend, and the resulting remained is entered.

(4) PROGRAM COUNTER (PC)

The program counter is made up of 16 bits and has an address region
of 64K bytes. The upper level 8 bits are called PCH and the lower
level 8 bits are referred to as PCL-
Normally, it would have the address to be executed next and would
be incremented only the number of bytes necessary fo the command
fetched.
When there is a branching commad in the oidst of the program the address
of the branch destination would be stored in the program counter. When
there is a reset (negative POR) input, reset vector which are in
addresses FFFF and FFFE enter respectively PCH and PCL and branching
takes place.


(5) STACK POINTER (SP)

The stack pointer is used to send data to RAM or to recover from
RAM when subroutine call, push (PUSH), pop (POP), or return (RET)
commands are being carried out. The address region indicated by
the stack pointer is within page 1 (addresses 0100-01ff)

--------------------------------------
 Fixed by Hardware     Determined by the Program.



When sending data to RAM, the stack pointer decreases by one
after sending data (post decrement) and increases by one prior
to restoring data (pre-increment).
The diversified activites of the stack pointer are summarized below:

SUB-ROUTINE CALLS

        --------------------------------------------------------
       |Stack Address|    Activity     |  SP Value after sending|
        --------------------------------------------------------
       |    SP       |  sending to PCH |       SP-1             |
       |    SP-1     |  sending to PCL |       SP-2             |
        --------------------------------------------------------


RESTORING FROM SUB-ROUTINE

        --------------------------------------------------------
       |Stack Address|    Activity     |  SP Value after sending|
        --------------------------------------------------------
       |    SP+1     |  sending to PCH |       SP+1             |
       |    SP+1     |  sending to PCL |       SP+2             |
        --------------------------------------------------------

To send to A register, X register, Y register, PSW to and from
the stack, the commands PUSH and POP can be used.

PUSH A (X,Y, PSW)

        ---------------------------------------------------------
       |Stack Address|    Activity      |  SP Value after sending|
        ---------------------------------------------------------
       |    SP       |sending of A (X..)|       SP-1             |
        ---------------------------------------------------------

POP A (X,Y, PSW)

        ---------------------------------------------------------
       |Stack Address|    Activity      |  SP Value after sending|
        ---------------------------------------------------------
       |    SP+1     |sending of A (X..)|       SP+1             |
        ---------------------------------------------------------

(6) PROGRAM STATUS WARD (PSW)

The program status ward is made up of the various flags which are
set and reset according to the results of the execution of 8-bit
register commads and the various flags which determine the
activities of the CPU. When reset it veocnes "000-0-00".

    7    6     5     4     3     2     1     0
  -----------------------------------------------
 |   N    V     P     -     H     -     Z     C  |
  ----------------------------------------------

Carry Flag (C).

After operation execution, this is set when there has been a carry
from the uppermost bit of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) or when
there has been no borrow. It is even altered with shift or rotate
commands. It also acts as an bit accumulator of Boolean bit operation
commands. It is set at the SETC commads and reset at the CLRC commads.
In addition, the carry flag inverts at the NOTC commads.

Zero Flag (Z)

Alter operation execution, this flag is set when the result is
zero and is reset whens the result is not zero. Even with 16-bity
operation commands, zero detection is carried out. It is possible
to carry out tests with conditional branching commands.

Half Carry Flag (H)

After operation execution, this flag is set when there has been
a carry from form bit 3 of the ALU to bit 4, or when there has
not been any borrow. There is no command to set, however, it is
reset by reset by means of the CLRV commad. At his time, the
overflow flag is also set.

Direct Page Flag (P)

This is the flaq which designates the direct page to which many
addressing mode are applicable, such as direct page addressing
etc. When 0, the direct page becomes the addresses of the
region 0000-00ff and when 1, it becomes the addresses of the
region 0100-01ff. It is set by the STEP command and reset by the
CLRP command.

Overflow Flag (V).

After arithmetic operation execution, this flag is set when
overflow or underflow has been produced. At this time, influence
is extended simultaneously to the H flag.
It is possible to carry out tests with conditional branching 
commads.

Negative Flag (N)

After operation execution, this flag is set when the values of
the result of MSD is 1 and reset when that values is 0. It is
possible to carry out tests with conditinal branching commads.

7.2. MEMORY SPACE.

It is possible for the Sound-CPU to address 64K bytes of memory.
Memory space is divide up according to purpose. From address
0000, 512 bytes are divided into two pages of 256-bytes units,
called zero page and page one. It is possible to access data
within these regions by means of numerous address modes, such
as direct page addresing, etc.
Page one is taken up by the stack.


7.2.1. Direct Pages (Zero Page, Page One)

By means of setting or resetting the direct page (P) flag
within the program status ward. it is possible to disignate 
whether zero page or page one is to be made the direct page.
it is set up such that the data within this page can be treated
with fewer bytes, at highter speed and with more numerous types
of commands and addressing modes.

   Stack Area
   ----------

   The stack region is established in the RAM region within page
   one. The uppermost byte of the stack address is fixed at 01.
   The lowermost byte of the stack address must be given its
   initial setting by the program.

7.2.2. Uppermost Page

Internal ROM Region

A mask ROM is installed within the Sound-CPU from FFC0H- FFFF. There
is a program in it which transmits data from the ROM cassette to the
256K bit RAM throuh the SCPU. This region is used by means of reset.

7.2.3. Area of Applicable Bit Operation Commads.

(i)   The commads SET1 (set memory bit) and CLR1 (clear memory bit)
      are applicable to one-bit data with the direct page.

(ii)  The commands TSET1 (test and set bit) and TCLR1 ( test and
      clear bit) are applicable to the total 64K byte region.

(iii) The Boolean operation commands (AND1, OR1, EOR1, MOV1, NOT1)
      are applicable to the 8K byte region of 0000 - 1FFF.

7.2.4. Direct Page Addressing

Since all of the addressing modes indicated in Table 7.2.4 are
applicable to the data of the direct page (P=0: addresses 
0000-00FF P=1: address 0000 - 01FF) designated by the direct page
(P) flag. it is possible to manipulate the data in various ways.
In additon byte efficiency also improves due to the fact that
direct address designation is possible by one-byte data within
the command words. Moreover, since effective commad cycles also
decrease data can be accessed more rapidly.
