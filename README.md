[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/bazzinotti/snestracker/_apis/build/status/bazzinotti.snestracker?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/bazzinotti/snestracker/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Congratulations, you have stumbled upon a rare item. Currently in its embryonic stages, snestracker aims to become a full-featured cross platform music production software for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System  (SNES), AKA the Super Famicom.

snestracker uses a custom SPC700 Audio Processing Unit (APU) emulator to produce cycle-accurate emulation, allowing you to create accurate SNES music in the comfort of your PC workstation.

snestracker will take advantage of the most important hardware Digital Signal Processing (DSP) features of the SNES, including noise, echo customization, pitch modulation, ADSR envelopes, stereo panning, and inverse phasing (surround sound).

The music that you create with SNES Tracker exports to various formats. It will export standalone music files in the form of a demo ROM, SPC, WAV. You will eventually be able to incorporate your new music and sound effects into your own custom programs / video games!

Here is an image of the current early prototype!

Debugger
========

In addition to the tracker, there is a debugger program that allows you to hone in on SPC files in various ways. Here is a preview of the main pane, based on raph's vspcplay.

Flash Carts
-----------
To play on the real Super Nintendo, you will need help of additional hardware, typically known as a flash cart:

- [SD2SNES](https://sd2snes.de)
- Super Everdrive
- [Tototek Superflash](http://www.tototek.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_8_11&products_id=39) (outdated)
