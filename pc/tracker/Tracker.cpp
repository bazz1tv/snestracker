Other ideas:

Project -- a project can consist of 1 or more songs. Songs glean from a
global bank of samples, instruments, and (if desired) patterns.

Mixer panel -- button like "Inst. Ed.", has slider gui elements to control
track volumes for the song, along with Main and Echo Volumes.

Interpolate parameter -- with tracker on a certain pattern/row, being able
to perform a special mouse click on allowed elements that will activate
interpolation, then -- moving to a forward pattern/row, FX elements will
be inserted that interpolate the start and end values of the selected
paramter (eg. echo volume)

FX Tracks -- there may be cases where this is not enough room for
inserting desired FX. In this case, why not have ability to add FX tracks?
Could do it like Renoise and just add fx columns under the desired track.

Support video game SFX - some games will want to play songs on tracks (eg.
7-8) and when sending the command to play a certain sound effect, that
track (if it has music) should mute the music for the time of the sfx
being played until it's finished.

Meta Instruments (SFX?) -
  can take up 1 or more tracks,
  selectable ability to run on a special global meta instrument timer.
	has priority over the physical tracks.

/* Notes:
 * When encoding WAV samples to BRR, you may want to Low pass filter
 * around 10-16 KHz. SNES is capable of max 16 KHz tones (based on 32KHz
 * sample rate), and even those are going to be worst quality of all tones
 * capable. So, to reduce noise in signal, consider trying that low pass
 * filter! */

/* For envelope FX, rules:
 * ok heres something i thought up:

 * params:    0: off

/* Inspired from RIFF headers, but simpler; To maintain an extendable file
 * format, different structures / elements need an ID byte to preclude the
 * data. There was some concern of whether the 255 ID constraint of 1 byte
 * would be exceeded, but Expansion Bytes can be set aside to extend the
 * available IDS. for Example, let's pretend the EXPANSION byte is 255.
 * Then when that byte is identified, code will understand the following
 * byte is an EXPANSION ID byte, which will enable another 255 IDS to be
 * utilized. AND, as if that isn't enough, more than 1 EXPANSION byte
 * could be present (eg. EXPANSION1, EXPANSION2, ...) */

/* Another cool idea; Sidechaining a voice from another voice. By using
 * some form of VxENVX or VxOUTX. Basically, the intensity of envelope or
 * sample amplitude, affects another specified voice or instrument's
 * volume value! But, sidechaining to volume is not the only possibility,
 * you could sidechain pitch or some other parameter. In fact, you could
 * sidechain not only from volume either, but from pitch or some other
 * parameter. I wonder what sonically attractive sidechaining
 * possibilities come to me?

 /*
		Ideas
		~~~~~

		Global vol/pan/etc envelope banks, just like sample bank is global now.
		Envelope Load/Save/Zap buttons like for inst/samples.

		SMRPG changes the envelope settings during a KON, typically to migrate
		from an infinite sustain release to a sudden one that is slower than an
		actual KOFF.
		--> Have KOFF optionally (checkbox) trigger a "KOFF envelope"

		Panning envelope can be retriggered at KON or constant. (checkbox)

		Instrument Detune setting. (seperate from sample fine-tune)
