/* When a new Song is created. we need to perform a minimal SPC emulator
 * init and load the driver into SPC RAM. Then the user must be able to
 * get their BRR samples into the song. Then edit pattern data. Then play
 * back that song.
 */

/* There are 2 similar notions to document. The PatternSequencer, and the
 * Pattern. The PatternSequencer is the area that sequences different
 * patterns into a song; a linear list that maps which patterns are
 * played.
 *
 * The Pattern represents each unique pattern data
 * of the song; The main composing area where notes and effects are
 * specified.*/

/* My thought process on how SNES Tracker will work regarding editing and
 * playback: The currently editing pattern is special in that it is fully
 * uncompressed and all edits are directly reflected in APU ram. Playing
 * back the current pattern plays back this uncompressed version. No
 * rendering required. However, for song playback, all patterns will be
 * rendered to a compressed format.
 *
 * After mulling it over, I am starting to think it's safest and best to
 * do all editing in PC memory, and anytime playback is requested, the
 * song data is compressed into the playback version in APU ram */

/* For packing the playback data. I am thinking about 2 major things
 *
 * 1. Pack note/inst/vol/fx/fxparam by using unused bits to specify what
 * bytes actually come next (similar to XM file format)
 *
 * 2. changing the pattern length per track. For some pattern, for each
 * track, a search is done to determine the last row of data. That row is
 * marked the length for that track of the pattern. During playback, the
 * track should wait for the pattern to finished (and marked free if
 * relevant to do so).
